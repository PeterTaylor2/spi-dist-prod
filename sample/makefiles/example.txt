# this means the following:
# 1. default build is for 64-bits (driven by SARTORIAL_CONFIG)
# 2. default compiler is msvc16 (driven by WIN32_COMPILER - this is from Visual Studio 2019)
# 3. No 32-bit python versions are available (G_WIN32_PY_VERSIONS and G_WIN32_PY_VERSION)
# 4. Use XL12 for building Excel (G_WIN32_XL_VERSIONS2 - XL4 is obsolete anyway)
# 5. For 64-bit python we have python3.7 which is also the standard version to use (G_WIN64_PY_VERSIONS and G_WIN64_PY_VERSION)
# 6. The location of 64-bit python is not overriden, hence is the one defined by ../win64.mk (G_WIN64_PYTHON37 etc)
